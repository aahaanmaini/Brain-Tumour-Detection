# Brain Tumour Detection üß†ü©∫

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras to classify MRI brain scans into tumour and non-tumour categories. It uses grayscale MRI images and includes data augmentation, custom model design, and evaluation on a validation and test set.
